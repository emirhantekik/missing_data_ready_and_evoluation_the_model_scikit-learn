The NAN data in the csv file was changed and the dataframe was created with the fetch_california_housing data in sklearn.datasets and the following steps were performed for machine learning, respectively
  1. Getting the data ready
  2. Choose the right estimator/algorithm for our models
  3. Fit the model/algorithm and use it to make predictions on our data
  4. Evaluating a model
 
 fetch_california_housing data transferred to dataframe. Read car-sales-extended-missing-data.csv and fixed missing data using SimpleImputer and columntransformer. Read hearth-disease.csv and split X(X is features) and y(y is label). Use test_train_split and 
create and fit model. Make predictions and evaluate model using evaluation functions. this function is Accuracy,precision,recall an f1 for classifier. this function is r2 score,MAE and MSE for regressor
